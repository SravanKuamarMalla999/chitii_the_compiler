# chitii_the_compiler
Chitii_the_compiler is a simple compiler that translates source code into LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR), then uses Clang to generate machine code executables. It supports lexical analysis, parsing, AST generation, and codegen, serving as a foundation for building more advanced language features.
